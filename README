This is an interface to manipulate a scratch-like character on a canvas using simple python (like sprite.rotate(angle)) syntax.

To use, edit userscript.py to tell the sprite what to do.  Has two modes (which you currently have to switch between in pyscratch.py, sorry) enabling maze-mode and scratch-mode.
